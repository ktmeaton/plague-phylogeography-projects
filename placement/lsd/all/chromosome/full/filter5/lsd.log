Collapse 0 (over 26) internal branches having branch length <= 7.40798e-10
 (settable via option -l)
Parameter to adjust variances was set to 4.09915e-06 (settable via option -b)
Calculating the outlier nodes with Zscore threshold 3 (setable via option -e)...
Minimum branch length of time scaled tree (settable via option -u and -U): 0
Estimating the root position on the branch defined by given outgroups ...
Computing confidence intervals using sequence length 674947425 and a lognormal
 relaxed clock with mean 1, standard deviation 0.2 (settable via option -q)
*RESULTS:
- There is not any outlier date.
- Dating results:
 rate 6.17038e-09, tMRCA -8352.77 , objective function 5.43153e-05
- Results with confidence intervals:
 rate 6.17038e-09 [1e-10; 3.40749e-08], tMRCA -8352.77 [-600787; -1493.06], objective function 5.43153e-05
