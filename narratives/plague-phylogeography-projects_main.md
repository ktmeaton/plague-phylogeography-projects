abstract: "
Plague has an impressively long and expansive history as a human pathogen. The earliest evidence of the plague bacterium *Yersinia pestis* comes from ancient DNA studies dating its emergence to at least the Neolithic. Since then, *Y. pestis* has travelled extensively due to ever-expanding global trade networks and the ability to infect a diverse array of mammalian hosts. Few regions of the ancient and modern world remain untouched by this disease, as plague has an established presence on every continent except Oceania.
