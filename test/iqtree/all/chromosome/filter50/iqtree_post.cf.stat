# Concordance factor statistics
# This file can be read in MS Excel or in R with command:
#   tab=read.table('/mnt/c/Users/ktmea/Projects/plague-phylogeography/results/iqtree/all/chromosome/filter50/iqtree_post.cf.stat',header=TRUE)
# Columns are tab-separated with following meaning:
#   ID: Branch ID
#   sCF: Site concordance factor averaged over 1000 quartets (=sCF_N/sN %)
#   sCF_N: sCF in absolute number of sites
#   sDF1: Site discordance factor for alternative quartet 1 (=sDF1_N/sN %)
#   sDF1_N: sDF1 in absolute number of sites
#   sDF2: Site discordance factor for alternative quartet 2 (=sDF2_N/sN %)
#   sDF2_N: sDF2 in absolute number of sites
#   sN: Number of informative sites averaged over 1000 quartets
#   Label: Existing branch label
#   Length: Branch length
