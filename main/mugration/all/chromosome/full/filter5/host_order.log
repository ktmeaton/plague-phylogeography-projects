NOTE: previous versions (<0.7.0) of this command made a 'short-branch
length assumption. TreeTime now optimizes the overall rate numerically
and thus allows for long branches along which multiple changes
accumulated. This is expected to affect estimates of the overall rate
while leaving the relative rates mostly unchanged.
