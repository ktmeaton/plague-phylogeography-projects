Removing outgroups of tree(s) ...

TREE 1
*PROCESSING:
Reading the tree ... 
Collapse 4 (over 599) internal branches having branch length <= 1.0566e-08
 (settable via option -l)
Parameter to adjust variances was set to 4.711e-07 (settable via option -b)
Calculating the outlier nodes with Zscore threshold 3 (setable via option -e)...
Minimum branch length of time scaled tree (settable via option -u and -U): 0
Estimating the root position on the branch defined by given outgroups ...
Computing confidence intervals using sequence length 47321424 and a lognormal
 relaxed clock with mean 1, standard deviation 0.2 (settable via option -q)
*RESULTS:
- The input dates associated with the following 3 nodes are considered as
 outliers, so those nodes were removed from the analysis:
 SAMEA3541827 SAMEA104488961 SAMEA1061800
- Dating results:
 rate 1.13851e-08, tMRCA -5755.67 , objective function 0.00148639
- Results with confidence intervals:
 rate 1.13851e-08 [1.06455e-08; 1.24908e-08], tMRCA -5755.67 [-6040.68; -5461.15], objective function 0.00148639
